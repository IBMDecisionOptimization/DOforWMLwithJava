# DOforWMLwithJava

This repository includes code to support execution of IBM Decision Optimization (DO) on Watson Machine Learning (WML).
DO is a set of modeling and solving libraries, along with development and deployment tools for prescriptive analytics using Mathematical and Constraint Programming techniques.
WML offers Python and REST API to develop and execute DO models.
The code included in this repository provides two ways to use WML.
1. in the `com.ibm.*` package are included classes to create models and deployments in WML, and then create and poll jobs. This offers a way to have detailed control on execution and integration of DO in WML.
2. in the `ilog.cplex.*` and `ilog.cp.*`packages ares included classes to  easily transform an existing Java code which models and execute a DO model i order to have executing occuring on WML.

## How to start?
In this section are described some common requirements to both packages.
